Just a template with some authentication and data code for making a Blazor Hybrid app. Handy for testing.

You will need to install the latest [Visual Studio Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/) and check the .NET Multi-platform App UI development to open the sln file and run it on a latest Windows machine.
